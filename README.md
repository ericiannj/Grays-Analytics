## Description

Gray's Analytics is an application created in Processing that presents two images and the respective graphics that demonstrate their shades of gray.
- First Image: Low resolution due to the similarity of the gray tone of the pixels.
- Second Image: Result of an equalizer filter equation that separates pixels into hue groups, generating greater differences between image regions and, therefore, greater resolution.

It is an example of how filters resulting from mathematical equations can impact image quality
